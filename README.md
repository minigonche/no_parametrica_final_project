# Nonparametric Statistics: 
## Final Project - Depths Measures

This projects explains and compares different measures of statistic depths, including:

1. Tukey Depth
2. Oja Depth
3. Liu Depth
4. Mahalanobs Depth

The script uses different libraries to compares this depth over different bivariate distributions.

This code correspondes to the solution of the final project of the course *Introduction to nonparametric statistics and resampling*, ofered at Universidad de Los Andes by Adolfo Quiroz on the first semester of 2017.

This project was solved with: Paula Rodriguez.
